# CsvGenericParser

Please Note the guess types is not for prodctuion hence why its marked as internal its more a tool to help with developemnt. think of it as a old perl scripts that does 90% of the work for you but output still requires a few tweaks here and there to get it running.

the parser its self is relatively stable this works for my needs but feel free to fork \ extend or just use Free for all
